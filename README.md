### State of the engine

This version of LoveXYZ is unstable and is not optimized.

This version is also pretty unfinished.

Will add more features and improve perf.

### Usage notes

* Supports simple triangle loading and obj model loading
* Supports simple shading (blinn-phong and shadow map shadows)
* You can cache textures and give them simpler names to use in other scripts
